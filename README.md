# Scrabble 2

<center><h2>This is still a Work in Progress!</h2></center>

This is a Scrabble Game which runs in the browser. It is written in Typescript.

Why 2? Because the first one was a flaming train-wreck. You can look at the source [here](https://github.com/RedDocMD/ScrabbleOnline). It is a good example of what *not* to do in a React app which has a fair amount of state and internal logic.

## Running

The app can be run by cloning this repo, installing dependencies and then running it. It requires [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).
```
git clone https://github.com/RedDocMD/Scrabble2
cd Scrabble2
yarn install
yarn start
```
